xmq is an Erlang library that provides cross message system utilities.

Features:

- AMQP to 0MQ bridge

* xmq_az_bridge

The (a)MQP to (z)eroMQ bridge lets 0MQ clients participate in an AMQP routing
scheme.

It works like this:

- Bridge connects to AMQP broker and binds a number of topics to a queue
- Bridge provides a ROUTER 0MQ socket
  - Clients routinely publish expirable routes
  - Clients send messages destined to AMQP
  - Clients receive messages routed by bridge from AMQP
- Bridge routinely unbinds topics as routes expire

* Utilities

** Routing Tables

The module xmq_routes provides these functions:

| add_direct(Key, Dest, Expires) | Adds a direct route    |
| get_direct(Key)                | Gets a direct consumer |
| add_topic(Key, Dest, Expires)  | Adds a topic route     |
| get_topic(Key)                 | Gets topic consumers   |

Routes expire if they're not routinely updated. Clients are expected to update
their routing information in regular periods to ensure they receive
messages. If a client doesn't update its routes, the routes will eventually
expire.
